                    <p>Netflix is the original major streaming option for home television audiences.
                       When it started nearly 20 years ago, Netflix was a subscription-based DVD service that would mail DVDs straight to your home. 
                       It still does that too (more on that later), but in 2007, Netflix debuted its streaming service, allowing viewers to watch thousands of on-demand TV shows and movies ad-free.
                       Ten years later, Netflix has become one of the biggest names in entertainment, producing critically acclaimed TV shows (Daredevil, House of Cards, Stranger Things, and Luke Cage,
                       to quickly name four) and movies and hosting original comedy specials.</p>
